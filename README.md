I will be integrating Volunteer Management System (developed during Google Summer of Code 2014 for the Anita Borg Institute Systers Community) for an Industrial Project course at my university from September to December 2014.

A detailed timeline as well as progress reports can be found in my blog [here](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~ummedini/comp4560/blog.html)
